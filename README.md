# Introduction

## Description

This is a prioritized list of primarily technical cyber security controls that was deduced by analyzing known cyber attacks, that took place over the last decade around the world; attacks which very likely would have been deflected if these controls were in place. This is original research, and it was not derived from any existing framework, guide, etc.

This work began in 2023 out of pure curiosity and a desire to answer a question: “What attack tactics & techniques (T&T’s) are the most common _today_, and how does their heatmap look like?” and, subsequently: “What is the minimum number of controls that should be put in place to defend against these T&T’s?”

Hundreds of attacks were mapped to MITRE ATT&CK, leading to a map of 500+ mitigation techniques, that were grouped, summarized, and finally compressed to just 15 unique controls. Additional details and notes were added to each control to ensure that critical requirements are not missed.

## Relation to the existing security frameworks

Established frameworks, such as ISO 27001, NIST CSF and CIS Controls, provide a comprehensive approach to managing security in an organization and should be used as main sources of knowledge. However, these frameworks require a security manager to spend quite a few hours (days, weeks) to conduct a risk assessment and figure out which controls are applicable and, sometimes, what do they mean… Unfortunately, this exercise often ends up being an educated guess, and, as the result, organizations tend to implement complex controls first while missing the basics. 

“Top 15” complements existing frameworks (standards, guides) by providing an opportunity to discover major security gaps in your company and prioritize controls implementation. The main idea here is that it should not take more than 15 minutes.


<br/>

## Who can use this and how?

**•	CISO, Head of Security, Security Managers, Consultants ** — as described above.

**Pentesters** — focus on the statistically most problematic parts of the attack surface.

**Vendors, Sales** — leverage real-world data when positioning your products/tools before clients.

<br/>

## Is there a list of tools (products) that can be used to close discovered gaps?

There is an accompanying list of vendors and their product available in the project’s **[GitHub repository](https://github.com/ValeriySh/ValsTop15)** in a file named **“Top15 - tools.xlsx”** The work on this document is still in progress, but one can get an idea of which products could satisfy the controls’ requirements.

<br/>

## I am representing a vendor; how can I add our tool (product) to the list?

Contact me by using **[GitHub discussions](https://github.com/ValeriySh/ValsTop15/discussions)** or **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valeriyshevtsov/)** (please include a note when connecting). If your product satisfies the requirements, it will be added to the list.

<br/>

## I would like to contribute to the project; how can I do that?

Same as above: contact me by using **[GitHub discussions](https://github.com/ValeriySh/ValsTop15/discussions)** or **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valeriyshevtsov/)**.

<br/>

## Where can I find the sources?

Everything is published in the project’s **[GitHub repository](https://github.com/ValeriySh/ValsTop15)**.
