# Introduction

## What is this?

This is a prioritized list of primarily technical cyber security controls that was deduced by analyzing known cyber attacks, that took place over the last decade around the world; attacks which very likely would have been deflected if these controls were in place. This is original research, and it was not derived from any existing framework, guide, etc.

This work began in 2023 out of pure curiosity and a desire to answer a question: “What attack tactics & techniques (T&T’s) are the most common _today_, and how does their heatmap look like?” and, subsequently: “What is the minimum number of controls that should be put in place to defend against these T&T’s?”

Hundreds of attacks were mapped to MITRE ATT&CK, leading to a map of 500+ mitigation techniques, that were grouped, summarized, and finally compressed to just 15 unique controls. Additional details and notes were added to each control to ensure that critical requirements are not missed.

<br/>

## Is it supposed to replace any of the existing security frameworks?

It’s quite the opposite: this list complements existing frameworks (standards, guides) by providing an opportunity to prioritize the implementation of controls according to their importance.

Established frameworks, such as ISO 27001, NIST CSF or CIS Controls, provide a comprehensive approach to managing security in an organization and should be used as main source of knowledge. However, many of these frameworks require a security manager to build a risk register and figure out which risks are more likely and/or more impactful than the others and plan cyber security controls to mitigate them. Unfortunately, without having a bigger picture, this exercise ends up being an educated guess at best — and reading the tea leaves at worst. As the result, organizations tend to implement complex controls first while missing the basics. This list is supposed to be such ‘pocket bigger picture’.

<br/>

## Who can use this and how?

**CISO, Head of Security, Security Manager, Consultant** — discover security gaps in [your] company in 15 minutes; prioritize controls implementation when using a cyber security framework.

**Pentester** — focus on the statistically most problematic parts of the attack surface.

**Vendor, Sales** — leverage real-world data when positioning [your] products/tools before clients.

<br/>

## Is there a list of tools (products) that can be used to close discovered gaps?

There is an accompanying list of vendors and their product available in the project’s **[GitHub repository](https://github.com/ValeriySh/ValsTop15)** in a file named **“Val's Top15 - tools.xlsx”** The work on this document is still in progress, but one can get an idea of which products could satisfy the controls’ requirements.

<br/>

## I am representing a vendor; how can I add our tool (product) to the list?

Contact me by using **[GitHub discussions](https://github.com/ValeriySh/ValsTop15/discussions)** or **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valeriyshevtsov/)** (please include a note when connecting). If your product satisfies the requirements, it will be added to the list.

<br/>

## I would like to contribute to the project; how can I do that?

Same as above: contact me by using **[GitHub discussions](https://github.com/ValeriySh/ValsTop15/discussions)** or **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valeriyshevtsov/)**.
